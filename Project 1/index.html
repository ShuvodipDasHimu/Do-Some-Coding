          <h2>Swordsman of Strawhat Pirates</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Roronoa Zoro</b> has devoted his life to becoming the world's
            strongest swordsman. Even before joining the crew, he was
            well-renowned for his outstanding abilities and accomplishments in
            battle. His skills drastically improved after becoming the combatant
            of the Straw Hat Pirates and undergoing a two-year training period
            under the "Strongest Swordsman in the World," Dracule Mihawk. After
            his crushing loss to Dracule Mihawk, he vowed never to lose again.
            Since joining the crew, Zoro has defeated several mighty
            adversaries, most of whom are fellow swordsmen.
